# ExpmV

This is a Julia translation of Awad Al-Mohy's and Nicholas Higham's
function for computing the action of a matrix exponential on a vector
without explicitly computing the matrix exponential.

The original code can be found at [Matlabcentral File Exchange](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29576-matrix-exponential-times-a-vector/all_files), and the theory is explained in [this](http://eprints.ma.man.ac.uk/1426/) preprint.
